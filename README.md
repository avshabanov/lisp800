lisp800
=======

lisp800 is based on Teemu Kalvas's lisp500. Lisp800 is an attempt to clean up the original Lisp500 source code to make it more useful for embedding and hacking.
The main goal is to make interpreter embeddable and multiple context-oriented.

## How to start
cd src
make
rlwrap ./lisp800 init800.lisp
